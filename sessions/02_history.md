# History

* 1979 the International Standards Organization (ISO) developed the Open Systems
  Interconnect (OSI) model

  
* In 1981 four minicomputers were connected to the network to exchange
  transactions between the UCSF registration systems, clinical laboratory,
  outpatient pharmacy and radiology systems – all built by different
  manufacturers.

* In 1985, the board of Simborg Systems, a struggling start-up company that sold
  StatLAN, a LAN-based best of breed solution, decided that in order to have
  commercial success there needed to be a non-proprietary OSI Level 7 healthcare
  protocol.

* 1987. An 'organizing meeting' was held on March 29/31, 1987 with the aim to create a
  standards organization. Simborg Systems invited the four hospitals that were
  the first four StatLAN users: Moses Cone, Auburn Faith Community, Rochester
  General and Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). They also
  invited the vendors that had agreed to use the StatLAN protocol at those
  initial four hospitals - mostly vendors of departmental systems. Sam Schultz
  (CIO at HUP) was asked to be the non-commercial organizer. [Sim13]

* In October 1987. HL7 version 1 was published 

* Version 2.0 was prepared subsequent to Plenary I in Tyson's Corner and
  presented at Plenary II in Tucson in September 1988.

* The first business plan and budget for HL7 were also written in 1991

* 1990s, an abstract model of the entire domain of patient care called the
  Reference Information Model (RIM)
  
* Interestingly, HL7 explicitly acknowledges the influence of philosophy
  in its creation of the RIM, whose act-centered view of healthcare draws
  for its underlying framework on the speech act theory developed by J. L.
  Austin in Austin (1962) and by John R. Searle in Searle (1969).

The RIM sees this idea of shared propositional content as an attractive
way of modeling how the domain of human actions is organized. In
sequences such as the sort described, we are to utilize the same RIM
‘classCode’ — for example ‘replenish bedding supplies!’ or ‘register
this patient!’ or ‘administer this drug!’ — to capture the common
content of what is involved in each successive act within the sequence,
combined with a succession of different ‘moodCodes’ (such as ‘order’
or ‘command’) to capture what is peculiar about each succeeding act.
The ‘model of healthcare information’ that is created in this way is seen
by the authors of the RIM as providing an efficient and reliable framework
for ensuring successful communication of meaning within and between
healthcare information systems
