## FHIR

### What is FHIR?

> FHIR® – Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (hl7.org/fhir) – is a next

> standards and applying a tight focus on implementability.


### What FHIR key features?

FHIR offers many improvements over existing standards:

  developers have had simple interfaces working in a single day)
* Multiple implementation libraries, many examples available to kick-start
  development
* Specification is free for use with no restrictions
* Interoperability out-of-the-box– base resources can be used as is, but can
  also be adapted for local requirements
* Evolutionary development path from HL7 Version 2 and CDA – standards can
  co-exist and leverage each other
* Strong foundation in Web standards– XML, JSON, HTTP, OAuth, etc.
* Support for RESTful architectures and also seamless exchange of information
  using messages or documents
* Concise and easily understood specifications
* A Human-readable wire format for ease of use by developers
